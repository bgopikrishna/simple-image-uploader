We came across your profile on Angelist for the role of Frontend Developer. We are glad to let you know that your profile has been shortlisted. As a part of the interview process, we have an assignment we would like to share with you. It's meant to gauge practical design thinking, code quality, structure, and so on.

Please create a simple app that includes the following:

1.  A web page where the user can upload an image

2.  Each image has to be exactly 1024 x 1024.

3.  Don’t upload the file if it’s not the right size

4.  Each image has to be converted into four different sizes.

horizontal : 755 x 450

vertical : 365 x 450

horizontal small : 365 x 212

gallery : 380 x 380

Images should not be stretched, they should be cropped.

5.  Save all four of these images locally on the server

6.  Show a webpage with all four of these new images.

Framework to use - React JS

Bonus: Instead of saving these files to the server, upload them to a cloud image hosting service.

Double Bonus: While uploading the image show a preview in the browser itself of all the different image sizes, and let the user decide how to crop the images to the smaller size.

If you have any doubts, feel free to ask. The style/design of the page is not very important, but application structure decisions are.

Please submit this assignment by 17th April, 2020. You can put this in a GitHub repo or just send us a zip file if you would prefer it not be public.
